In this project, I utilized the robust .NET Core 5 framework to create a web application. 
The project leverages the ASP.NET Core Web App template, implementing individual user account authentication type automatically generates adata folder for secure information storage.
 An Application follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, and the Razor Runtime Compiler makes sure that content loads smoothly when a webpage is refreshed, improving user interaction. 
An eye-catching design was provided by the integration of a Bootswatch theme, which enhanced the user interface.
I also added a dropdown menu for content management, which improved the functionality of the website.
 During development, debugging was done through the use of breakpoints. Moreover, the project was expanded with the creation of three new projects (AkshitsBooks.DataAccess, AkshitsBooks.Models, and AkshitsBooks.Utility), each serving specific functions.
Data and view, among other existing folders, were copied over to these new projects. 
To optimize data handling, essential packages like Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore, Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Relational, and Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer were installed. Together, these metrics support the project's performance and robustness.
